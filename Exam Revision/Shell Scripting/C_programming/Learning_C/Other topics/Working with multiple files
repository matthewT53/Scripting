/* ======== Working with multiple source files =================== */

extern int flag; // flag is a global var in one file and to use this int from other files, this declration must be included in these files.
For functions, simly palce the function prototpye in each file that uses the function. Note the function can only be defined once (i.e not in all the files)

Internal linkage:
* global variables and functions can only be used by other functions in the same file
* external linkage is when these functions and global vars can be ued by other source files as long as these files have proper prototypes and extern declarations.
* Using static with a global variable or function prototype reinforces the principle of least priviledged, only allowing functions in the same file to use these functions and global vars.
