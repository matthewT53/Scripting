Regex notes:
[] - where a bunch of characters is between the square brackets. Matches with any patterns that contain either of the characters
[^] - exclude some characters
\d (meta character)- any number
\w - any character
\W - non-alphanumeric character
. - can be used to match any character
\. - can be used to match the dot character
{} - an interger(s) resides between the brackets 
[]{} - same thing as above, just applies to a collection of characters
* - specify 0 or more
+ - specify 1 or more
? - optionality, match 0 or 1 of the preceding character or group.
e.g ab?c will match abc or ac
^..$ - match every character between start(^) and end($)
(..) - capture group, capture a group of items (allows the results to be shown on some regex engines)
(..(..)) - nested group capture

e.g (\d+)x(\d+) to extract height and width from height x width
