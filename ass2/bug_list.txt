BUGS:
* When searching, relevant posts are not being returned
* After deleting a user and posts and comments featuring them prevent other pages from loading
* Each comment box needs a unique id

Things to test:
* Test "about me" and viewing other user's "about me"
* Test the match suggestion and pagination for it are working

TODO:
* Get links working for mates that are tagged. just need to style it so it looks better
* Search image is a bit off
* Implement read more button for comments and replies (If have time)
* There is random spacing from the top of the page to the navbar
* Find sources for copied css and stuff

Additional:
* Password hashing Sha-256

Mate suggestion algorithm: Time complexity:
Worst: O(current_user_mates x mates_of_a_mate x _num_courses_current_user)
my %potential_mates = ();

get all the mates of the current user
get courses of the current user as an array
foreach mate of the current user
    get the mates of this mate = list1
    foreach mate_of_mate in list1:
        if they are not the current user's mate:
            store in hash "potential_mates" with a score of 1
            get all the courses of the mate_of_mate as a str
            foreach course that the current user is taking
                if this course matches any courses that the mate_of_mate is taking:
                    increment the hash value
                END_IF
            END_FOR
        END_IF
    END_FOR
END_FOR
